I used a clean architecture for this app which is feature first layer
For networking and API requests, I used dio package which is a powerful and customizable HTTP client for Dart.
For storing data locally , I used floor package. 
For State Management, I used flutter_bloc that helps manage state in a scalable and testable way.
For dependency injection, get_it package is used,a simple service locator,making it easier to manage app-wide services and repositories.
